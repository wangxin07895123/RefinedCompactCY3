# Refined BPS numbers on compact Calabi-Yau 3-folds from Wilson loops

This repository contains research data associated with the paper [arXiv:2503.16270](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16270) titled "Refined BPS numbers on compact Calabi-Yau 3-folds from Wilson loops". 

The information includes BPS data for

1. Elliptic $`\mathbb{F}_1`$
2. Model 2A, 2B
3. Model 3A,3B,3C

The format is

dlist4[$`\beta`$]={ {$`2j_L,2j_R,(-1)^{2j_L+2j_R}N_{j_L,j_R}^{\beta}`$}, ... }
